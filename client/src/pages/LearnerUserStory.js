        <p>As a beginner to coding, I want to learn the basics of how to build an app for free. I would like to use a basic, flexible lesson plan to keep organized
with coding resources provided for self learning and a coding professionalâ€™s feedback on my code. I would like a fun, colorful learning environment because colors make me happy! Using the feedback I receive, I will learn and improve, as a coder. After using this website, I intend to continue to improve my coding skills by building websites and apps for fun.
